    "\n",
    "This notebook reviews a bottom-up design process to create a Python function.  In this example, we want a function that will compute the roots for a sequence of quadratics where each quadratic is a row of a matrix and the three columns of the matrix are the three coefficients a, b, and c &ndash; as in ax&ast;&ast;2+bx+c = 0 &ndash; in that order.\n",
