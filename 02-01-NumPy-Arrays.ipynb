    "Python lists are useful for manipulating lists of information, especially lists of strings and lists of mixed types.  But Python was not originally developed with numerical analysis in mind, so vector and matrix arithmetic was problematic.  As engineers and scientists became increasingly interested in Python various numerical analysis libraries were developed for Python in the mid 1990s.  Eventually they gained the support of Python's inventor who initiated Python Version 3.0 in part to augment Python to make array computing more accessible and efficient.  The \"NumPy\" organization consolidated many of those efforts in 2005 and continues to further develop their NumPy library to this day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NumPy library is widely used and relies on the exhaustively researched and tested BLAS specifications and LAPACK libraries.  You are encouraged to read about BLAS and LAPACK online, though you will understand them more at the end of this class than at the beginning.  You may occasionally see messages for warnings or errors related to BLAS and LAPACK.  The warnings are usually gripes about how Python implements them on your particular CPU and can be ignored.  And trust us:  any errors are yours, not theirs."
