    "This tutorial will not directly help you get the Class 05 in-class exercise done.  It may help you think more clearly and more efficiently about programming the LU decomposition method, and that may help you with the exercise.  But if it somehow reveals the solution to the exercise in an \"Aha!\" moment, then it has failed.  You must learn how to \"think in loop space\", with all of its indexing tricks and traps, and you will only learn that by struggling with problems again and again.  Not by seeing any answers.\n",
