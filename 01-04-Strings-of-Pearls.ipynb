    "You may recall from previous tutorials that sometimes strings and ints can be operands in the same expression, such as for \"hi\"&ast;3.  This depends on how the operator is <i>overloaded</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer programming, an operator can be made to behave differently depending on the types of its arguments.  This is why 1+1 results in 2, but 1+1.0 results in 2.0:  an int plus an int results in an int, while an int plus a float results in a float.  A string times an int (and an int times a string) results in the string repeated that integer number of times.  However, a string times a float will result in an error, similar to how a string plus an integer resulted in an error:  those operators are not overloaded in those ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator overloading may seem like unnecessary complication, but even in formal mathematics operators are widely overloaded but are not universal.  One can add scalars, and one can add vectors -- two mathematically different operations that are called \"addition\".  But we can't add a scalar to a vector.  And yet, just as we can multiply a scalar with a scalar, we can multiply a scalar with a vector.  But there are two common ways to multiply a vector with a vector:  dot products and cross products.  And how to \"multiply\" matrices is definitely not what someone would expect without a course in matrix algebra.\n",

    "We saw another example of operator overloading when we discussed the unary \"-\" operator for negation and the binary \"-\" operator for subtraction.  Operator overloading is a form of \"polymorphism\", a terms we will discuss later in the course when we introduce \"object oriented programming\"."
